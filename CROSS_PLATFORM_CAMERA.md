| **iOS** | ✅ Native Camera | Opens front-facing camera |
| **Web** | ✅ Browser Camera | Uses browser camera API |

## 🎯 How It Works

### Platform Detection
```dart
bool get _isCameraSupported {
  if (kIsWeb) return true; // Web browsers support camera
  try {
    return Platform.isAndroid || Platform.isIOS || Platform.isMacOS;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

### Intelligent Camera/Gallery Selection

**For Android/iOS/macOS/Web:**
- Click "Take A Photo" → Opens camera directly
- Front-facing camera by default
- Auto-requests camera permission
- Captures and uploads instantly

**For Windows/Linux:**
- Click "Select Photo" → Opens file picker
- User selects existing image from disk
- Shows helpful message: "Camera not available. Please select an image from gallery."
- Same upload process

## 📝 Code Changes

### 1. Added Platform Imports
```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart' show kIsWeb;
import 'dart:io' show Platform;
```

### 2. Added Platform Detection Method
```dart
bool get _isCameraSupported {
  if (kIsWeb) return true;
  try {
    return Platform.isAndroid || Platform.isIOS || Platform.isMacOS;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated `_takePhoto()` Method
```dart
Future<void> _takePhoto() async {
  // ...
  
  if (_isCameraSupported) {
    // Use camera for supported platforms
    photo = await _picker.pickImage(
      source: ImageSource.camera,
      preferredCameraDevice: CameraDevice.front,
      imageQuality: 85,
      maxWidth: 1024,
      maxHeight: 1024,
    );
  } else {
    // For Windows/Linux, use gallery
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      const SnackBar(
        content: Text('Camera not available. Please select an image from gallery.'),
        backgroundColor: Colors.orange,
      ),
    );
    
    photo = await _picker.pickImage(
      source: ImageSource.gallery,
      imageQuality: 85,
      maxWidth: 1024,
      maxHeight: 1024,
    );
  }
  
  // ... rest of upload logic
}
```

### 4. Dynamic Button Text
```dart
Text(
  _isCameraSupported ? 'Take A Photo' : 'Select Photo',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: 14 * scaleFactor,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
    color: Colors.white,
  ),
)
```

## ⚙️ Platform-Specific Permissions

<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" android:required="false"/>
```
✅ Already added

### iOS (`Info.plist`)
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your camera to take a selfie for identity verification.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>We need access to your photo library to select a selfie for identity verification.</string>
```
⚠️ Add if testing on iOS

### Windows
No special permissions needed! File picker works out of the box.

### Web
Browser automatically requests camera permission. No configuration needed.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Windows button still says "Take A Photo"
**Solution**: 
- Restart app
- The button text changes based on `_isCameraSupported`
- Should automatically detect Windows and change to "Select Photo"

### Issue: "Camera not available" shows on Android
**Solution**:
- Check camera permissions in device settings
- Make sure camera is not being used by another app
- Restart device

### Issue: File picker doesn't open on Windows
**Solution**:
- Make sure image_picker plugin is properly installed
- Run: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- Rebuild: `flutter run -d windows`

### Issue: Web camera doesn't work
**Solution**:
- Use HTTPS (required for camera on web)
- Allow camera permission in browser
- Check browser console for errors
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
