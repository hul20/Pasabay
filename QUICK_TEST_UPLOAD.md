## Common Issues & Solutions

### ‚ùå "User not authenticated"
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in before testing

### ‚ùå "Bucket does not exist"
**Solution**: Create the `verification-documents` bucket in Supabase Storage

### ‚ùå "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Add the RLS policies for storage access

### ‚ùå "relation does not exist"
**Solution**: Run the SQL script to create verification_requests table

### ‚ùå Camera not working on web
**Solution**: 
- Use Upload button instead of Take A Photo
- Or test on mobile device
- Camera requires HTTPS in production

### ‚ùå File picker not opening
**Solution**: Check browser permissions for file access

## Expected Behavior

### Loading States
- ‚úÖ Buttons disabled during upload
- ‚úÖ Spinner shows "Uploading..."
- ‚úÖ Cannot click continue until complete

### Success States
- ‚úÖ Green success messages
- ‚úÖ Checkmark icons
- ‚úÖ File previews/names display
- ‚úÖ Can change/reupload files

### Error States
- ‚úÖ Red error messages
- ‚úÖ Can retry upload
- ‚úÖ Form stays on current screen

## Quick Commands

### Check if table exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM verification_requests;
```

### View your uploads:
```sql
SELECT * FROM verification_requests 
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

### Check storage bucket:
```sql
SELECT * FROM storage.objects 
WHERE bucket_id = 'verification-documents';
```

### Delete test data:
```sql
-- Delete from database
DELETE FROM verification_requests WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Delete from storage (do this in Storage UI, or via SQL):
DELETE FROM storage.objects 
WHERE bucket_id = 'verification-documents' 
AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text;
```
